        <p className="answer">
          Each candidate market is scored on six independent dimensions, then
          combined into a single <strong>composite score</strong> using
          theory-grounded weights. The formula is:
        </p>
        <p className="answer" style={{ fontFamily: "var(--font-mono)", fontSize: 12 }}>
          composite = ODI × 0.25 + Fit × 0.15 + Constraint × 0.15 + Coverage
          × 0.15 + VN × 0.10 + Incumbent × 0.20
        </p>
        <p className="answer">
          Thresholds: <strong>&gt; 7.5 → Pursue</strong> |{" "}
          <strong>5.0–7.5 → Investigate</strong> |{" "}
          <strong>3.0–5.0 → Defer</strong> |{" "}
          <strong>&lt; 3.0 → No-Go</strong>. The purpose is to surface the
          best risk-adjusted bets quickly, not to replace customer-discovery
          interviews. Every investigate recommendation should be validated with
          real buyer conversations before resource allocation.
